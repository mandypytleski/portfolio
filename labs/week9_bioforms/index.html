            <p>Hello! My name is <span class="name">Mandy Pytleski</span>. I'm a third year student at Stout majoring in Computer Science with minors in Math, Digital Marketing, and Web Technology. I am an Event Lead for Service Club at Stout. I am a member of the Honors College. I have worked for housing every year that I have been here.</p>
            <p>I am originally from a very small town in southern Minnesota called East Chain. My graduating class was 18 so you know we were small. East Chain has three different zip codes and doesn't have any stores/gas stations/anything except churches and houses.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to sew, hang out with friends, play video games, and lots of other hobbies.</p>

            <h3 class="clear">Goals For This Year</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Get an internship for the summer</li>
                <li>Sew a bit more</li>
                <li>Be proud of the work I've done</li>
