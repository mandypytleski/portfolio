    <h2>ALLLLLL About Me</h2>
    <p>
As you already know, my name is Mandy Pytleski. I'm a second year student at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. I am majoring in computer science with minors in math, digital marketing, and web technology. I plan on graduating in December of 2026. </p>
    <p>
I love working on both front end and back end projects. This gives a change to showcase my problem solving skills while also being creative. I also love diving into the analytical side of things and understanding what the technology will be used for, tying in the marketing side of my education. </p>
      
	  <p>I have experience in a variety of languages including Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and SQL and would love to learn more!    </p>

    <h2>Now for the fun stuff</h2>
    <p>
		While at Stout, I am part of the Stout Symphonic Band in the percussion section. I love playing mallet instruments and challenging myself musically. I am also a Service Lead for the Service Club at Stout. I help to plan events to get people on campus involved in service projects. 
    </p>
  
	<p>
		I grew up playing as many sports as I could. Now that I'm not actively competing, I still love to stay active. I regularly go to the gym or hike whatever trail I can find. I'm also currently helping coach my high school's softball team.
	</p>
	<p>
		To fuel my creative side, I love to sew; especially cross stitch. This is something I learned when I was a kid and have grown a lot ever since. I love watching everything come together from the start and turn into something I can be proud of.
