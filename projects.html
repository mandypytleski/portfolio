        <h3>Huffman Coding</h3>
        <p>This project is a classic. To save space when sending documents, you can use Huffman Coding to shrink the size of the doc. This project uses a variety of data structures, including maps, trees, and priority queues in C++. Taking a given string, this project will transform the text into binary and then converts it back to text.</p>

        <h3>This Website!</h3>
        <p>This website was my first time making a website completely from scratch. It utilizes HTML and CSS to look professional but still add a bit of personal flare. It holds my resume, projects I've worked on, contact information, and information all about me; perfect for employers!</p>

        <h3>Minecraft Project Database</h3>
        <p>This project was a fun one for me! I created a database to help keep track of projects in my Minecraft world. It tracks, players, builds, materials needed for each build, who worked on what projects, and the purposes for different projects. It handles many to many relationships and cascades on delete. In the future, I'm planning on creating a website to connect to this database.</p>
